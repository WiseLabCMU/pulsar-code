Overview
========
The SAI Demo application demonstrates digital audio playback. The demo performs audio playback from a .wav
file, stored in on-chip flash. The project also uses the CMSIS-DSP library to perform a Fast Fourier Transform, and to 
return the fundamental frequency of the audio.

- IAR embedded Workbench 7.50.1
- Keil MDK 5.17
- GCC ARM Embedded 2015-4.9-q3
